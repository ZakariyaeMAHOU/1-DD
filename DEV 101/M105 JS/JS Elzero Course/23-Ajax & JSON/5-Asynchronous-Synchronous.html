            To Understand Ajax, Fetch, Promises
            
            Asynchronous vs Synchronous Programming
            - Meaning
            
            Synchronous
            - Operations Runs in Sequence
            - Each Operation Must Wait For The Previous One To Complete
            - Story From Real Life
            
            Asynchronous
            - Operations Runs In Parallel
            - This Means That An Operation Can Occur while Another One Is Still Being Processed
            - Story From Real Life
            
            - Facebook As Example
            - Simulation
            
            Search
            - JavaScript Is A Single-Threaded
            - Multi Threaded Languages
